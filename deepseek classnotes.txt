chatgpt == deepseek 
deepseek -== high flery research unit

high fleyrs is -- stock & trade platfrom 
deepseek launched -- market crased 

450 million parameter 

CAR( wheels, seat, stearig)

5 seater car 
7 seater car ( has more parater) more cost 

many llm model

deepseek (670 billion paramet)  give more information compare to other llm

 
-- introduce
-- deepseek vs chatgpt
-- intro about deepseek
-- scan the qr code
-- deepseek model	 ( v2, v3, vl2, r1)
-- what is mean by parameter 
-- previous video ( you can undestan )
-- practicle 

deepseek model integrates with hugging face & also integrates with groq

using ollam any use can build llm mode in custom. local machine any one can build the 
deepseek. 

most of the organization they are using ollama in their platform.

------
Project-01 :
------
1- google - type ollama.com
2- after you open this page ( every model user can visibale)
3- windows - download 
4- after download please install it 
5- vs code or cmd prompt
6- we learned how to check version 
7- ollama --version 
	ollama
	ollama pull deepseek-r1
	ollama list
	ollama run deepseek-r1
8- we run deepseek model locally 
====
9- vs code 
10- create new file 
11- langchain framework 
		pip install --upgrade langchain langchain-community 
		pip install -U langchain-ollama
		pip install streamlit
		
12- langchain is framework to build llm model 
		
	custome model -- you can finetune llm model 
	llm model -- chatgpt has develope ( you cannot finetune)
	
		
		
machine learning  -- trained historical labeld data ( excel, csv ) to build predict model by using algorithm
	regression 
	classificaiton
	clustering
		user hast to traind

NLP, DL, 
	develoer trained data unsupservie( text, image , video, sensor, drone)
		user has to train 
		
geneartive ai 
	user no need to the train the data 
		data has pretrained by openaai, deepseek, gemin, llama 
	pretrained model done by -- bert, transformer, transfer learning
	gan
	vqgan
	taming transform
	autoencode
	
====
you will get errros only 1 reason ( ollama not install proper, reinstall again, 
				1st more space required
I tried with other using ollama but deepseek-r1 locally
====

project:2 -->
	deepseek integration using openrouter
	
interface -->
	hugging face
	groq 
	openairouter

1- googe 
2- openrouter.ai
3- search model box -- type deepseek -r1 free
4- scroll down -- create api key 
5- copy api key -- 
6- copy the opeani-python integration code
7- google - google colab - crate new notebook

>>> 2025 job opening in data science sector
<think>
Okay, the user asked about 2025 job openings in the data science sector. Hmm, first off, they
might be planning their career ahead. It's a bit futuristic to talk about 2025, so I should make
that clear and encouraging.

I remember from earlier we discussed job openings, so maybe they're looking for opportunities now
but are considering future trends. They might want to know what skills will be needed or if data
science is still growing.

Looking up the latest trends, AI and machine learning are definitely big right now, but 2025 could
see even more advancements with quantum computing and edge computing becoming important. I should
highlight these areas because they're promising.

Also, industries like healthcare, finance, and tech are booming, so mentioning those will give
them specific sectors to look into. Networking is key in any job search, especially in tech, so
advising them to leverage LinkedIn makes sense.

I need to make sure my response is positive and motivating, letting them know the demand is
growing. That should help them stay optimistic about their career prospects.
</think>

The data science sector continues to grow rapidly as organizations increasingly rely on
data-driven insights to make informed decisions. While I can't predict exact job openings for
2025, here are some trends and considerations that might be relevant:

### Key Trends in Data Science:
1. **AI and Machine Learning**: These technologies are becoming more widespread across industries,
creating a demand for roles in AI/ML engineering, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.

2. **Data Engineering Roles**: As organizations generate more data, there's a growing need for
professionals who can handle large-scale data pipelines and infrastructure.

3. **Python and R Continues to Dominate**: These programming languages remain the most popular
tools in data science, with Python being especially dominant due to its versatility and frameworks
like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

4. **Big Data Technologies**: Tools like Hadoop, Spark, and cloud-based platforms (AWS, Azure,
Google Cloud) are critical for handling massive datasets, creating demand for big data engineers
and scientists.

5. **Data Visualization Experts**: With tools like Tableau, Power BI, and D3.js becoming more
popular, roles in data visualization are also growing.

6. **Cybersecurity in Data Science**: As industries handle more sensitive data, there's a growing
need for security experts to protect against potential breaches or misuse of data.

7. **Ethics, Privacy, and Compliance (EPC)**: The increasing focus on ethical AI, data privacy
regulations (like GDPR), and compliance requirements is creating new opportunities in these areas.

8. **Interdisciplinary Roles**: Data science is becoming more interdisciplinary, requiring
collaboration between computer scientists, statisticians, domain experts, and business leaders.

### Job Openings in 2025:
If you're looking for data science job openings in 2025, here are some sectors and roles to
consider:

1. **Healthcare and Biotech**: Rising demand for predictive analytics, clinical trial analysis,
and genomic data science.

2. **Finance (Banking)**: Roles in quantitative analysis, risk management, algorithmic trading,
and fraud detection.

3. **E-commerce/Supply Chain**: Companies are using data to optimize inventory, personalize
customer experiences, and improve supply chain efficiency.

4. **Autonomous and AI-Driven Industries**: Sectors like automotive, robotics, and smart
manufacturing will heavily rely on data-driven decision-making.

5. **AI Governance and Strategy**: Roles in defining organizational strategies for AI adoption and
ensuring ethical AI practices.

6. **Global Companies Expanding Internationally**: Multinational corporations are increasingly
using data science to compete globally, creating opportunities across various geographies.

### How to Prepare:
- **Update Your Skills**: Focus on acquiring skills in machine learning libraries (TensorFlow,
PyTorch), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and advanced tools like Python's pandas and NumPy.

- **Learn About AI and Ethics**: Understand the principles of AI ethics, data governance, and
privacy to stay relevant.

- **Expand Your Network**: Join data science communities on LinkedIn or GitHub, attend industry
conferences, and participate in hackathons to build your network.

- **Stay Updated with Trends**: Follow platforms like KDnuggets, Analytics Vidhya, and Medium's
Data Science section for the latest insights.

In short, the demand for data science professionals is not only growing now but will likely
continue to grow into 2025. With the right skills and focus on emerging trends, you can stay ahead
in this competitive field! Let me know if you'd like more tailored advice or resources. ðŸ˜Š
